Grand challenges: 
We are having a project that we can help you store your own blood sample (including genetic information) for Free. We are aiming to store it for life long run so it could potentially benefit your future health; However we have limited slots so we want to give it to the people who value it the most 
If you would like to participate. Please send a message about what do you think storing your blood can benefit yourself and why it is valuable.
